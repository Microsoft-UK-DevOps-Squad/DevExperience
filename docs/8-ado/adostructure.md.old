## Azure DevOps Structure


# Azure DevOps Setup and Operating Model

Azure DevOps has a number of different services that need to be considered when setting up the service and the operational model to support the use and adoption by teams. It's key to look at the structure of an organisation to best align this model for supporting growth and usability moving forward.

This guide is prescriptive in providing a way to get started with a view to scale moving forward.

Azure DevOps consists of a number of different structures and products that need to be considered where setting up the service.

## Get Started

1. [Plan your Organization Structure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/user-guide/plan-your-azure-devops-org-structure?view=azure-devops)
   - **What is an Organization?**  
      It's the primary entity point (e.g. <https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization>}) into Azure   DevOps where projects and supporting products are hosted.
   - **One or Multiple Organizations**  
      One organization works for most scenarios and is a good starting point where multiple projects and teams can be added to an organization, which can drive productivity and adoption initially.

      Going with a multiple organizations model is generally driven by the need for teams and projects to work in isolation and/or require a different security model across different of a company.

4. [Project](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/projects/about-projects?view=azure-devops)
![Projects](../../assets/devops%20projects%20process.png)
    - An organization can have multiple projects and it's key to look at the project structure. Asking questions like:
      - Do we need one project per Team?
      - Do we need one project per Business Area?
      - Do we need one project per product?
      - How do we collaborate across teams and projects?
      - How much organizational structure change do we expect?

      The questions above start to build out a picture that informs the Azure DevOps project and also can impact the organization design.

      As if there's a lot of organizational structure change. How would you make sure the Azure DevOps design can handle it without a lot of redesign and moving projects and teams around?

      Some examples:

         - By creating a project per Business Process Area (e.g. Payments) if the names and structure of the organization changes the Payments BPA project should still be valid including the team membership.
    - Define process for Access, Roles and Permissions at Project and Team level prior to creation of first project. (tbc - build out more info)
        - Roles and Responsibilities (tbc)
    - Define process for Service Connections and Agent Pools

![Pipelines](../../assets/devops%20pipelines%20process.png)
    - Best practice is to move to YAML pipelines for both build and release pipelines.
    - This allows for managing the pipelines as code and storing them in repos to drive consistency and audibility linked to builds and releases.

         - For security and scalability its recommended  to use safe-hosted agents for pipelines.
