## Branching Strategy

The more people work in one project the more important a good branching strategy becomes. Even more once multiple teams work on the same project and share outcomes with other project teams. Branching strategies depend on the priject management, project size, stakeholders involved, production cycle, maturity of the team. A best practice example how Microsoft does branching is a case study of a complex project with multiple teams involved. The case study is available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/devops-at-microsoft/branching-strategies?view=azure-devops).
