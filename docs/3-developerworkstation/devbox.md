## Dev Box

# Streamlining Developer Onboarding with Microsoft Dev Box
In the realm of software development, bringing new developers up to speed with a codebase can often be a lengthy process. Itâ€™s not uncommon for it to take several days or even weeks for a developer to reach the point where they can effectively build and debug their code. This is a challenge that Microsoft Dev Box aims to address.

# What is Microsoft Dev Box?
Microsoft Dev Box is a platform designed to expedite the onboarding process for developers. It empowers developers with the ability to control and create their own workstations, start and stop those workstations, and even hibernate and create new ones.

Teams are given the autonomy to define what goes into a workstation and which connections are used. Meanwhile, IT departments can set and define central policies, network connections, and ensure all policies from Intune pass through onto the dev boxes.

# Customization at its Core
One of the key features of Dev Box is its ability to be customized. A dev lead configures a code file, checks it into source control, and then the dev team can maintain their customizations by adding onto this file. This allows the pre-configured environment to evolve over time with the project rather than maintaining countless baked-in images.

# Flexibility and Control
With Dev Box, developers are afforded tremendous flexibility. They can self-serve, scale up or down these workstations instantly by setting a new skew within the service, isolate work, secure environments by only providing the resources or endpoints that they need access to. They can even start to onboard vendor teams and contractors through the same tools and resources your dev teams use.
